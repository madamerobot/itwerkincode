        <p class="flow-text">Hi, my name is Valerie and I recently decided to drop my marketing career to learn how to code. After around 6 months of teaching myself JavaScript via YouTube, I attended a Coding Bootcamp at NYCDA. My first plan was to learn coding in order to become a Product Owner, but then I got stuck with the dream of working with Sublime every day (really, I swear!).<p>
        <p class="flow-text">I soon encountered the challenge of not knowing anything about this new industry. How much do I have to know as a Junior Developer? Where can I keep learning after the bootcamp? Which type of roles are even out there? And how can I get my foot in the door?</p>
        <p class="flow-text">That's why I decided to go a bit over the top with my homework and instead of creating a random User App with AJAX and POSTGRES, created this.</p>
