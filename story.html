        <h5>How did you get into coding?</h5>
        <p class="flow-text">
        I graduated from a business degree, but really didn't feel like that would be my dream profession. I wanted to learn something more 'hands on', and was thus deciding between Hyper Island or New York Code and Design academy. I eventually decided for NYCDA, because it seemed to be more tangible what you learn.

        <p class="flow-text">
       4 months ago, I started an internship at MOBGEN, a digital consultancy with inhouse production. I am part of the back-end team, and learn shitloads of new things every day.
